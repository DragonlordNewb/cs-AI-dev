# Me
Send me issues for my repositories if you can find them, it's a big help :D  
My ***Keeneyed-5*** repository is my prototype artificial general intelligence algorithm that is currently under construction. I might not update this file frequently, so I'll also say that I am training it to be inclusive of the future. In addition, I'm working on some physics simulation engines (Sandsea) and some other things that I keep on my other account, [Dragonlord Newb](https://github.com/DragonlordNewb), which is for my more serious stuff, including the Vicaria AI and the Lux programming language interpreter.
